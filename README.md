Cherry Doom is a fork of [Nugget Doom](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom) intended to add even more features.

**Note**: this README and the rest of documentation are updated on a per-commit basis, meaning that they may not correspond to the latest release.

If you're seeking information on the version you're using, please refer to the documentation included with it.

## Demo compatibility notice
Although the new code has been written with the intention of not breaking demo compatibility, it has not been properly tested yet.
**RECORD DEMOS AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

## Features

**Important to note**:
- This feature list is relative to [Nugget Doom's](https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom/blob/master/README.md#features)
- Some of Cherry Doom's features come from other sources. The initial implementations for those are _ported from (p.f.)_ or _inspired by (i.b.)_ said sources. These acknowledgements are included in the feature list
- Some config variables (CVARs) don't have a corresponding menu item and can only be changed by editing `cherry-doom.cfg`. For these, a "_CFG-only_" label is present and the CVAR name is included for guidance

### General

- _Mute Inactive Window_ setting [p.f. [International Doom](https://jnechaevsky.github.io/inter-doom/)]
- _Floating Powerups_ setting [p.f. International Doom]
- _Rocket Trails_ setting [p.f. [Doom Retro](https://www.doomretro.com/)] (with extended customization via the _Rocket Trails Interval_ and _Smoke Translucency_ settings)
	- Just like in Doom Retro, rocket trails are disabled if a [DSDHacked](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DSDHacked) patch replaces the rocket smoke thing definition or any of its states or sprites
- _Mouselook_ option for the _Stretch Short Skies_ setting to enable sky stretching only when mouselook is enabled
- _Less Blinding Tints_ setting

#### Intermission screen

- Settings to show _Health & Armor_ and _Weapons_ widgets alongside the detailed time widget
- Setting to _adjust intermission kill percentage to follow UV max speedrun requirements_ (CFG-only: `inter_accurate_kill_count`)
	- Specifically, it prevents resurrected and Icon of Sin-spawned monsters from increasing the totals, and also makes 100% show up for maps without monsters
- Items percentage is now 100% on maps without items

### Status Bar/HUD

- _Movement widget_: shows the current player movement and strafing speeds

#### Crosshair

- _Disable On Slot 1_ setting [i.b. [_Precise Crosshair_ mod](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=64788)]
- _Detection of Targets in Darkness_ setting (the required light level is customizable through the CFG-only `hud_crosshair_dark_level` CVAR) [i.b. [_Target Spy_ mod](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=60784)]

### Enemies

- _Blood Amount Scales With Damage_ setting [i.b. Doom Retro]

### Miscellaneous

- Hints for some disabled menu items, explaining the reason they are disabled
- Most setup menus have been rearranged (utilizing the new _scrollable subpages_ feature) to make navigation easier
- _Disable Stats Tracking_ setting for the _custom skill_

### _Level Table_

The _Level Table_, inspired by (and initially ported from) DSDA-Doom, provides a way to track your progress across the levels of a WAD.

This feature tracks statistics, such as the _skill level_, _kills_, _items_, _secrets_ and _time_, and allows you to see all that information in one place (including a _Summary_ screen, with overall statistics for the current WAD), also giving you the ability to warp to any map conveniently from the same screen.

Compared to DSDA-Doom's implementation, there are a few notable additions and changes:
- Setting to toggle _stats tracking_ (CFG-only: `lt_enable_tracking`)
- Command line parameter to _disable stats tracking_ (`-notracking`)
	- This can be used as a temporary alternative to the `lt_enable_tracking` CVAR
- Setting to toggle _tracking kills and time for maps not beaten from a pistol start_ (CFG-only: `lt_track_continuous`)
	- This setting is enabled by default; the old behavior _(before 2.0.0 and in DSDA-Doom)_ is equivalent to it being disabled
- Setting to toggle _resetting stats for the current level upon beating the level on a new best skill (except Nightmare)_ (CFG-only: `lt_reset_on_higher_skill`)
	- This setting is enabled by default; the old behavior is equivalent to it being disabled
- The ability to see (and warp to, but not track stats for) all loaded maps (not just maps from the WAD that is the last in the load order), grouped by WAD filename
- _Stats tracking_ now ignores WADs without maps when creating data folders for stats files
- _Level Table Stats Format_ setting (CFG-only: `lt_stats_format`)
- Press `Del` to _erase selected map stats_
- "Reset to defaults" button repurposed for _erasing current WAD stats_
- WAD stats are now written to the file every time a level is beaten, and not just when you quit the game
- Various visual changes

## Compiling

The Cherry Doom source code is available at GitHub: <https://github.com/xemonix0/Cherry-Doom>.

It can be cloned via

```shell
git clone https://github.com/xemonix0/Cherry-Doom.git
```

### Linux, and Windows with MSYS2

The following build system and libraries need to be installed:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org) (>= 3.9)
- [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2) (>= 2.0.18)
- [SDL2_net](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net)
- [openal-soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft) (>= 1.22.0 for PC Speaker emulation)
- [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile) (>= 1.1.0 for MPEG support)
- [fluidsynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth) (>= 2.2.0, optional)
- [libxmp](https://github.com/libxmp/libxmp) (optional)

Usually your distribution should have the corresponding packages in its repositories, and if your distribution has "dev" versions of those libraries, those are the ones you'll need.

Once installed, compilation should be as simple as:

```shell
cd cherry-doom
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
```

After successful compilation the resulting binary can be found in the `src/` directory.

## Windows with Visual Studio

[Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) comes with built-in support for CMake by opening the source tree as a folder.

Install vcpkg <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows>. Integrate it into CMake or use toolchain file:
```shell
cd cherry-doom
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
cmake --build build
```
CMake will automatically download and build all dependencies for you.
