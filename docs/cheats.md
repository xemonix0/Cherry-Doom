## Boom and MBF cheats

In Boom, many of them had a TNT prefix, which was removed in MBF.

`COMPx`  
Show current [complevel](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Woof!#Compatibility_modes). If you type a number, the engine will switch to this complevel. Not safe, for full compatibility set complevel in the menu and restart the level.

`IDK`  
Gives all keys.

`WEAP`  
Type WEAP, then type a number (`1-9` in Doom 2, `1-8` in Doom). The selected weapon which is associated with that slot will either be added or removed, depending on whether you have it or not.

Toggle fast weapons.

`GIBBERS`  
Force gibbing on dying enemies, independently of damage dealt.

`RIOTMODE`  
Make enemies alerted by the player attack all sentient entities (including other enemies),

`IDFLY`  
Toggle Fly Mode (uses jumping/crouching keys).

`SUMMON[X][Y]`

For example, to spawn a hostile Shotgun Guy (whose index is 2), the full cheat would be `SUMMONE002`.

Actors are always spawned facing the same direction as the player.
If the automap is enabled and the Follow Mode is off, the actors will be spawned where the pointer is located.
Otherwise, they will be spawned in front of the player.
