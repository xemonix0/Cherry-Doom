## Boom and MBF cheats

In Boom, many of them had a TNT prefix, which was removed in MBF.

`COMPx`  
Show current [complevel](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Woof!#Compatibility_modes). If you type a number, the engine will switch to this complevel. Not safe, for full compatibility set complevel in the menu and restart the level.

`KILLEM` / `TNTEM`  
This cheat kills all monsters on the map. If there are no enemy monsters on the map and you type this, it will kill all friends on the map (not including the player, of course).

`FAST`  
Toggles fast monsters.

`SMART`  
Toggles smart monsters (the "remember previous enemy" option in the Enemies menu).

`HOM`  
This cheat toggles the Boom [HOM](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Hall_of_mirrors_effect) detection feature. Depending on your settings, HOM will appear either as solid red or as a red flashing area when this cheat is enabled.

`KEY`  
Type KEY to bring up a menu, then type `R`, `Y`, or `B` to choose a key color (red, yellow, or blue). Then, type `C` or `S` to select card or skull. Once you make the final selection, the key will either be given to you if you don't have it, or it will be taken away. This lets you select the key you need (especially useful in maps with missing keys).

`IDK`  
Gives all keys.

`WEAP`  
Type WEAP, then type a number (`1-9` in Doom 2, `1-8` in Doom). The selected weapon which is associated with that slot will either be added or removed, depending on whether you have it or not.

`AMMO`  
Type AMMO, then either type a number from `1-4`, or `B` for Backpack. The selected ammo will be added or taken away. Ammo types are bullets, shells, rockets, and cells.

`TRAN` or `MBFRAN`  
This code toggles translucency rendering effects.

Toggles pitched sounds (the "pitch-shifted sounds" option in General menu).

`ICE`  
Toggle Boom friction effects.

`PUSH`  
Toggle Boom pusher effects.

`NUKE`  
Toggle the effects of damaging sectors.

## New Woof! cheats

Most of them were taken from ZDoom, Crispy Doom and DSDA-Doom.

`SPECHITS`  
Triggers all [Linedef actions](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type) on a map at once, no matter if they are enabled by pushing, walking over or shooting, or if they require a key. It also triggers all boss monster and Commander Keen actions if possible.

`NOTARGET`  
Toggle deaf and blind monsters that do not act until attacked.

`IDDKT`  
Centers the automap around the lowest numbered alive monster that counts towards the kill percentage. If used again, it will center the automap around the next alive monster, and so on.

## New Nugget Doom cheats

Most of them were taken from or inspired by other ports -- see `README.md` for credits.

`FULLCLIP`  
Toggle infinite ammo.

`VALIANT`  
Toggle fast weapons.

`BOBBERS`  
Shortcut to toggle the two cheats mentioned above, and IDFA.

`GIBBERS`  
Force gibbing on dying enemies, independently of damage dealt.

`IDFLY`  
Toggle Fly Mode (uses jumping/crouching keys).

`SUMMON[X][Y]`  
Spawn an actor based on its mobj type index, where:

- `X` is either "E" to spawn a hostile actor, "F" to spawn a friendly actor, or "R" to repeat the last spawn.
- `Y` is a three-digit number specifying the type.

For example, to spawn a hostile Shotgun Guy (whose index is 2), the full cheat would be `SUMMONE002`.

Actors are always spawned facing the same direction as the player.
If the Automap is enabled and the Follow Mode is off, the actors will be spawned where the pointer is located.
Otherwise, they will be spawned in front of the player.

`IDDF[C][T]`  
Find a key on the Automap.
This cheat functions similarly to the `KEY` cheat, with `C` and `T` specifying the key color and type respectively.

Resurrect the player without toggling IDDQD.

`TRAILS`  
Enable visualization of hitscan trails.

Toggle Linetarget Query Mode, which gives some info on the player's linetarget (i.e. the shootable thing being aimed at).

`MDK`  
Perform a hitscan attack of 1-million damage.

`SAITAMA`  
Toggle MDK Fist (replaces A_Punch's melee attack with the MDK attack, featuring an alternate multi-shot attack when holding down Strafe On).

Toggle explosive hitscan attacks for the player's ranged hitscan weapons
